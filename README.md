# quizChallenge

 ### For this challenge build a simple quiz program.

<p>It will ask a series of questions and evaluate each answer.</p>

<p>The program should keep track of the number of questions answered correctly.</p>

<p> After all the questions are answered the program should display the number of</p>

<p> questions that were correctly answered.</p>

<p>And the number that the player got wrong.</p>

<p>First use a two dimensional array.</p>

<p>You should use a two dimensional array to hold the questions and the answers.</p>

<p>Each element of the array represents one question and

is itself an array composed of two elements.</p>

<p>The question and the answer.</p>

<p>Create a two dimensional array with at least three questions in it</p>

<p>Use a loop to cycle through each question.</p>

<p>Ask it, and compare the response from the player to the answer in the array.</p>

<p>You can use the prompt method to ask the question.</p>

<p>You'll then use a conditional statement to see if the player's answer

matches the real answer.</p>

<p>When the loop is done, you should know how many questions were correctly answered.</p>

<p>Print that out to the webpage.</p>
